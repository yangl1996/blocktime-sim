This is a simulation that demos the effect of block time in interactive
applications. To run the simulation locally, download this directory and run
the following command. You will need to have go (Golang) installed.

    go build && ./blocktime-sim

You may change the parameters that the simulation uses. For example, you may
start the simulation with the following command.

    ./blocktime-sim -n 50ms -b 1s

It is also possible to host the simulation in a web page by compiling it to
Webassembly. There are instructions at
https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/webassembly.html.

This is a simulation that demos the effect of block time in interactive
applications.

To change parameters, look at this section of the code.

    // 100 ticks per second
    if g.currentTick - g.lastBun >= 1 { // block time = 10ms
        g.lastBun = g.currentTick
        g.bunX, g.bunY = g.b.read(10) // network propagation time = 100ms
    }

The line

    if g.currentTick - g.lastBun >= 1

controls block time. Replacing the number 1 with number x sets block time to
x*10 milliseconds.

The line

    g.bunX, g.bunY = g.b.read(10) // network propagation time = 100ms

controls network propagation time, i.e., the time it takes for a transaction to
travel from users's computer to the sequencer and for the response to get back.
Replacing the number 10 with y sets network propagation time to y*10
milliseconds.

To run the simulation locally, download this directory and run the following
command. You will need to have go (Golang) installed.

    go build && ./blocktime-sim

It is also possible to host the simulation in a web page by compiling it to
Webassembly. There are instructions at
